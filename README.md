# 💳 Loan-Default-Probability  
### Machine Learning Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to **predict the probability of loan default**. The goal is to classify borrowers into **default** or **non-default** categories using historical loan and borrower data.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Binary classification task: **Default (1)** vs. **Non-default (0)**
- Based on structured input features (e.g., income, loan amount, credit score)
- Comparative analysis of multiple machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation using both accuracy and risk-sensitive metrics

---

## 📦 Key Steps

- Data preprocessing and feature transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and validation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - AdaBoost
  - Random Forest
- Performance benchmarking across models
- ROC and AUC analysis to assess classification quality
