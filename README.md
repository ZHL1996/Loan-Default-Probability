# 💳 Loan-Default-Probability  
### Machine Learning Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to **predict the probability of loan default**. The objective is to classify loan applicants into **default** or **non-default** categories using historical loan and borrower data.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Binary classification task: **Default (1)** vs. **Non-default (0)**
- Use of structured borrower-level data (e.g., income, credit score, loan amount)
- Application of supervised machine learning algorithms
- Evaluation based on classification accuracy, AUC, precision/recall, and confusion matrix

---

## 📦 Key Steps

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model training and validation using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation
- Performance comparison and selection of best model
